# Disparity Plugin

Version 1 of a disparity plugin node. Used to apply a disparity map to a mono image and create stereo. Disparity maps for use with this plugin should be created with red(left eye) and green(right eye) channels. 

Plugin dll here was compiled in VS2017, the foundry strongly insists plugins should be compiled in 2015 so recompilation might be in order.
